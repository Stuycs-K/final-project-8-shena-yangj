## Overview
This is a Tower defense game. Mobs follow a path, and if they reach the end of the path, the total health of the user decreases. If the total health reaches 0, then the user loses. The user may place towers anywhere not on the path that will attack Mobs in a certain range. If the Round timer runs out and the total health is not yet 0, the user wins. 
## Instructions
Mobs are automatically generated. You can place towers by clicking one of the rectangles in the Menu. Each tower has certain stats such as attackSpeed, which is how fast they attack the mobs, and attackPower, or how much damage they do. Click the rectangle of which tower you want to place, then click the tile that you want to place the tower in. If you do not have enough money (shown in the Balance section at the bottom of the menu), you cannot place a tower.
