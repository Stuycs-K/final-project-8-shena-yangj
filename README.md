# APCS Final Project
## Group Info
Amber Shen and Jason Yang from APCS class period 8.
## Overview
This is a Tower defense game. Mobs follow a path, and if they reach the end of the path, the total health of the user decreases. If the total health reaches 0, then the user loses. The user may place towers anywhere not on the path that will attack Mobs in a certain range. If the Round timer runs out and the total health is not yet 0, the user wins. 
## Instructions
Mobs are automatically generated. There are regular mobs and tank mobs. Tank mobs have greater health and attack power compared to regular mobs, and also have armor. 
<br><br>You can place towers by clicking one of the rectangles in the Menu. Each tower has certain stats such as attackSpeed, which is how fast they attack the mobs, and attackPower, or how much damage they do. Click the rectangle of which tower you want to place, then click the tile that you want to place the tower in. If you do not have enough money (shown in the Balance section at the bottom of the menu), you cannot place a tower. You cannot place a tower on the path. 
<br><br>Upgrades: You can click an individual tower to see it's stats, and upgrade that tower. Upgrades include increasing the range or attack power.
<br><br>Power ups: You can activate various power ups, which the yellow squares beneath the tower list. These include slowing down mobs, increasing the amount of money you earn, a fireball, and more. Power ups have a timer of 5 seconds, which is shown after activation. 
<br><br>Levels: There are three levels to the game: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Medium has the player earn less money per moment of time, while Hard has that as well as faster mobs.  You can have multiple rounds within a game.
<br><br>Your balance and the round timer are shown at the bottom of the menu. If you do not have the required balance, you cannot place towers, upgrade towers, or activate power ups.
